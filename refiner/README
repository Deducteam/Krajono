Lambda-prolog implementation of CIC
===================================

This is very much WIP.

It seems that a bug affects this code:

  http://code.google.com/p/teyjus/issues/detail?id=86

The file evalexp.c extends the "_ is _" predicate with a hopefully
reliable test for flexibility: "M is dummy" does not give a type error
but rather succeeds or fails depending on the flexibility of M.
This hack is required for refiner.mod.
