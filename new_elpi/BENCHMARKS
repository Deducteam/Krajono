    Partial commit, many changes.
    
    1. AST moved from Lprun2 to the parser and generalized to lambdas,
     etc. Several files are now broken and commented out because of this.
    2. the parser now parses lambda-abstractions correctly
    3. patternunif is now able to unify abstractions

    Some bugs in the Makefile fixed + new test for unification of lambdas.

    Partial commit that implements pattern-unification.
    
    So far:
    1. type of terms generalized to accomodate lambda-abstractions
       and metavariables applied to a list of variables
    2. variables and constants unified. Constants are given negative
       numbers, variables will be given non negative ones.
    3. ad-hoc Prolog case implemented everywhere to make our tests pass.
    
    TODO: do the benchmarks on CSC's laptop.

    Yet another implementation to save String.compare.
    
    strings mapped in 1-1 correspondence to integers and integers
    used. The reverse mapping is only used during pretty-printing.
    Concretely, it does seem to have no effect (to be better tested
    on CSC's laptop).

    Commit c79d0e3007f66eb553b6d50338faca1e09d8d064 reverted.
    
    Incredibly, systematically projecting out of a pair when looking for
    clauses is slower (on our example??) than comparing strings using
    String.compare. This is probably sensitive to the name of the constants
    used in the program, but for the time being I revert the commit.

    Semantics of cut fixed and many more tests for cut added.
    
    NOTE: we used to implement cut using an integer lvl. But
    such an implementation is probably not possible because
    alternatives with the same lvl could be related to different
    choice points. Indeed, both our old implementations and the
    original elpi failed on some of the new tests. The new
    implementation replaces indexes with pointers to previous
    alts (i.e. pointers in the or-list), so that we are sure where
    we need to stop (like the WAM does btw).

    Using pairs string*uniq-int for constants.
    
    Pros: saves up string comparison time when indexing
    Cons: requires a snd during indexing.
    
    Outcome: to be tested on CSC's laptop. We expect this
    version to be slighly faster, but who knows.

    Enrico's partially tail recursive, slow unification reverted.
    
    Previous non tail recursive unification made "more tail recursive" in the
    case of binary applications. The test does not require more stack space,
    but this is obviously test dependent. This version is the fastest we
    tried so far.
