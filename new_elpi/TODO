Benchmarks:

0. modify lambda3 to use the bound variables (via a list, etc.)
1. http://www.cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/lambda-examples/
   vedi lpcic/elpi/doc/termrep.pdf

Bugs:

1. ?n == ?n

Possible optimizations:

1. avoid unifying the head of the clause
2. optimize neck-cuts during the indexing phase (? maybe not easy/possible)
3. the to_heap could keep the highest non-bound variable to be cached in
   the UVar to make restriction linear
4. compact representation of UVar^d c1 ... cn
5. read-only arrays in place of lists

Missing:
1. occur-check
2. full lambda-prolog
