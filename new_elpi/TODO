Bugs:

1. ?n == ?n

Possible optimizations:

1. avoid unifying the head of the clause
2. optimize neck-cuts during the indexing phase (? maybe not easy/possible)
3. the to_heap could keep the highest non-bound variable to be cached in
   the UVar to make restriction linear

Missing:
1. occur-check
2. full lambda-prolog
