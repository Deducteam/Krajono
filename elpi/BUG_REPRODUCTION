1) Start the command

rlwrap ./elpi bench/sources/hollight/hollight_safe.mod  < BUG_INPUT

And see the output. It works as it should

2) comment out the $print line 102 of hollight_safe.mod and run again

It will fail with a restriction exception. Moreover, when printing here and
there, you can notice that terms are reduced/instantiated incorrectly. For
example, you get the subterm  (thenl h [] x2) in place of (thenl h [])
