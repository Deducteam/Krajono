Other:

0. pretty-printing to LaTeX + transformation to standard presentation
   (with fresh variables, etc.)
1. implement delay and experiment with it for:
   a) unif outside the fragment
   b) avoid the creation of Explicit Substitutions ??
   c) avoid failure of the "is" predicate?
2. The brackets it Teyjus are needed for the right precedence,
   for example look at reduce.mod.

Benchmarks:

0. modify lambda3 to use the bound variables (via a list, etc.)
1. http://www.cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/lambda-examples/
   vedi lpcic/elpi/doc/termrep.pdf
2. port all examples we have to Teyjus as well
3. port Teyjus pnf.* and its examples to newelpi
4. port Teyjus hc_interp.* to newelpi
   Note: it is outside the fragment and it needs to be brought
   back in.

Bugs:

-2. revise all the assert false/raise Failure
0. turn =, or, sigma, etc. into Custom predicates?
   In particular, it should not be allowed to add more clauses to them
   via implication.
0.1. turn = into a builtin (more efficient?)
1. a & b :- c  is parsed incorrectly (wrong precedence)
   and not at all in the toplevel

Possible optimizations:

-3 parser: test if it gets quicker defining lp directly, without using
   LIST1 clauses + List.concat
-2 optimize the case of app_deref where we can stay in the fragment
   after the beta (maybe already done?)
-1. if full_deref only works on heap terms, why do we pass all that stuff?
    why not calling deref instead?
0. Try alternative implementation for ?n == ?n
   (i.e. go back to the previous unif code, but change to_heap/restrict)
   NOTE: in the WAM the check is for free. An uninstantiated variable
   points to itsefl. So X=X is implemented making X points to X, i.e.
   leaving X uninstantiated. We cannot do that easily for two reasons:
   a) Fields of a constructor cannot be mutated in ocaml <=4.3.
   b) Our variables can occur multiple times applied to different arguments.
      To exploit the WAM's representation we should replace our
      UVar of ... * term list with a UApp (UVar ..., term list) but then
      we need a deep pattern matching everywhere and this could slow down
      again.
   TO BE TRIED (??)
2. the to_heap could keep the highest non-bound variable to be cached in
   the UVar to make restriction linear

Missing:
0. accumulate + fixity

=============================================

How to implement substitution:

- in full lambda-prolog:
  reduce (app (lam F) T) (F T).

- in the fragment: using the copy clause.
  reduce (app (lam F) T) R :- pi x\ copy x T => copy (F x) (R' x), R = R' x.

  copy (app M N) (app M2 N2) :- copy M M2, copy N n2.
  copy (lam F) (lam F2) :- pi x\ copy x x => copy (F x) (F2 x).
